It stems from a January executive order by President Trump that formed the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. \r\n\r\n* Key figures involved include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and SEC Chair Paul Atkins.\r\n\r\n* The report supports crypto innovation and recommends a clear regulatory framework, including a right for individuals to self-custody assets and expanded oversight powers for the CFTC over non-security spot markets. \r\n\r\n* It also pushes for guidance on crypto taxation, particularly concerning unrealized gains, wrapping transactions, and de minimis use.\r\n\r\nA major highlight is the plan to form a strategic US crypto reserve, including assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This reserve will be funded through forfeiture proceedings and administered by the Treasury. \r\n\r\n* The Bitcoin portion is not intended to be sold but kept for strategic objectives.\r\n\r\n**What’s Next: **The report complements recent legislative progress, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins and the Clarity framework for broader market regulation, signaling the US is moving toward a more structured crypto policy era.\r\n\r\n**Why it Matters:** This marks the strongest policy endorsement of crypto from the US government, laying the groundwork for self-custody rights, market clarity, and a national crypto reserve.\r\n\r\n**Our Take:** The report signals that the US is finally treating crypto as strategic infrastructure, not just speculative tech. Expect real regulatory movement ahead.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0527dc80-ade1-46a8-8bce-b259d4df58aa/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**GLOBAL LEGAL ROUNDUP**\r\n\r\n### **America:**\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲 **DOJ** [backtracks](https://www.theblock.co/post/364788/doj-wont-pursue-charges-against-dragonfly-exec-says) on pursuing charges against Dragonfly.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** Democrats** [press](https://cointelegraph.com/news/warren-democrats-press-occ-how-deal-with-trump-crypto-ties) bank regulator on Trump stablecoin conflicts.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲 **Uniswap, a16z, and allies** [urge](https://www.theblock.co/post/365317/uniswap-a16z-and-allies-urge-senate-to-carve-out-defi-in-market-structure-bill) Senate to protect DeFi developers.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲 **Firms** [amend](https://www.theblock.co/post/365168/firms-amend-sol-fund-filings-as-they-look-to-get-the-secs-approval) SOL ETF filings as they look to get the SEC's approval.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** US appeals court** [overturns](https://www.theblock.co/post/365052/us-appeals-court-overturns-opensea-product-manager-nathanial-chastains-wire-fraud-and-money-laundering-conviction) OpenSea product manager’s conviction.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** SEC Chair** [calls](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chairman-atkins-reshore-crypto-companies-back-to-the-us) to ‘reshore crypto’ as companies move back to the US.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** SEC** [approves](https://www.theblock.co/post/364703/sec-approves-in-kind-redemptions-for-spot-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-increases-options-limits) in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲 **SEC Chair Atkins** [debuts](https://www.theblock.co/post/365096/sec-chair-atkins-debuts-project-crypto-to-update-rules-and-regulations-with-a-focus-on-onchain) 'Project Crypto' to update rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲 **Sen.
