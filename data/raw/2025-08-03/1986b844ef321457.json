That’s 1.47 million BTC, or about $167 billion worth as of now.\r\n\r\n\"We wouldn't want to own all of it—we want everyone else to have their piece,\" said Saylor.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s not all. Strategy CEO Phong Le said during Thursday’s earnings call that the company aims to [have the biggest corporate treasury](https://decrypt.co/333218/public-keys-strategy-metaplanet-bitcoin-coinbase-xrp), regardless of asset type, aiming to top Berkshire Hathaway’s $328 billion stash of cash and cash equivalents.\r\n\r\nStrategy Could Buy as Much as 7% of Bitcoin Supply, Says Michael Saylor: (https://decrypt.co/333164/strategy-could-buy-7-percent-bitcoin-supply-michael-saylor)\r\n\r\nPublic Keys: Strategy Eyes Domination, Metaplanet Bitcoin Barrage, and Coinbase XRP Boost: (https://decrypt.co/333218/public-keys-strategy-metaplanet-bitcoin-coinbase-xrp)\r\n\r\nCrypto Rally Stalls as Dogecoin Tanks and Bitcoin Tests Key Support: Analysis: (https://decrypt.co/333192/crypto-dogecoin-tanks-bitcoin-price-tests-support-analysis)\r\n\r\nAncient Bitcoin Whale Moves Millions in BTC After 12 Years: (https://decrypt.co/333219/ancient-bitcoin-whale-moves-millions-btc-after-12-years)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n## 📊 Myriad Market of the Day\r\n\r\nSharpLink’s SBET above $20 at market close on August 5?: (https://linea.myriadprotocol.com/markets/sharplink-s-sbet-above-20-at-market-close-on-august-5)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n## 💬 Quote of the Day\r\n\r\n““[Strategy] is not just buying Bitcoin anymore, but instead engineering a corporate treasury machine designed to generate Bitcoin-denominated returns, manage its capital raises with precision, and scale faster.”“ — [Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer](https://decrypt.co/333157/benchmark-705-target-strategy-treasury-domination) thinks Strategy’s stock price could nearly double\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n## 🥇 Be First to Market With Myriad\r\n\r\nJoin the [Myriad Markets Telegram](https://t.me/myriad_markets_alert) to see the latest prediction markets the second they drop! \r\n\r\nWith [Myriad](http://myriad.markets/), the on-chain prediction market launched by _Decrypt_’s parent company DASTAN, you can break the news and stake the news, using USDC and points.\r\n\r\nJoin now (https://t.me/myriad_markets_alert)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n## 🌐 From Our Hubs\r\n\r\n🎮️ GG: A Pressure Group Forced Steam to Remove Adult Games.
