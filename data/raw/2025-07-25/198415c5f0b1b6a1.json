I should have been deployed into kHYPE last week, but I have an embarrassing admission. \r\n\r\nI unstaked from the validators I was supporting, but didn’t realize the 7 day wait time was for transferring HYPE from Staking side back to Spot (not from unstaking from the validators). Basically I had to wait an extra 7 days once I realized my error. However, I’ve told myself this gave me an extra 7 days to monitor for security issues or exploits (thankfully none).\r\n\r\n**So far I’ve:**\r\n\r\n1. Staked all my HYPE on Kinetiq and converted to kHYPE (usable in DeFi) which yields **2.11%.**\r\n\r\n2. Moved all of my kHYPE to [Felix](https://www.usefelix.xyz/) where I’ve deposited into the vanilla vault and am borrowing HYPE against my kHYPE collateral (paying a hefty **12% borrow rate**).\r\n\r\n3. Taking my borrowed HYPE and staking it again for kHYPE and depositing into the Kinetiq Veda vault that’s farming **6% APY** + airdrop rewards from other protocols.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8ee5f0e2-27e1-497a-be2f-e13323f6f52e/Screenshot_2025-07-24_200730.png?t=1753412871)\r\nCaption: This is the Kinetiq/Veda vault with rewards from: Kinetiq, Felix and Hyperlend\r\n\r\nThis isn’t +EV from a pure yield perspective by any means, but I’m doing this to try to get exposure to airdrops of the 2 protocols that I see being the major players in the HyperEVM ecosystem in Kinetiq and Felix.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nOne other thing I’m really looking into is once again from [Hyperbeat](https://app.hyperbeat.org/earn). They are teaming up in all the best ways with [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) to run a similar style playbook that they ran, but on HyperEVM.\r\n\r\nCheck out this thread from Stephen from DeFi Dojo on their beHYPE vault:\r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/phtevenstrong/status/1947496203324952986)\r\n\r\nRight not this vault is about 1/3 full with ~$35M in TVL and I think they are capping it around $100M.\r\n\r\n## **Yield Trading**\r\n\r\n[Pendle ](https://www.pendle.finance/)just listed siUSD YT/PT from [Infinifi](https://infinifi.xyz?ref=DEFIDAD).\r\n\r\nDue to the way Infinifi adds duration and handles yields, there’s a potential opportunity here 👀 \r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/RobAnon94/status/1948170684158656727)\r\n\r\nOK so what does this semi cryptic tweet above mean and how do we tie this back to siUSD YT on Pendle?\r\n\r\nInfinifi has a partnership with Ethena where they are maintaining 51% exposure to Ethena assets. This is a very symbiotic relationship, but out of the gate the Ethena yields have been lagging a bit because funding rates have been down. \r\n\r\nSee below the current basket of Ethena PT assets have been between **7.32% APY and 11.28% (~avg 9.6% APY):**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/71df79b4-e2e9-4709-9fa1-2a183902e21b/Screenshot_2025-07-24_202226.png?t=1753414101)\r\nCaption: You can look all this information up on the Infinifi stats page and these positions are found under “illiquid” section.\r\n\r\nHowever, as animal spirits have come back to crypto, a lot has changed in the last few weeks and sUSDe has shot up from lows of ~**5% to 12% while the PT assets have gone up to 15%+**\r\n\r\nWhy does this matter right now?\r\n\r\nInfinifi allows you to get exposure to all of these Ethena yields while providing you with auto rollover so you never have to manage PT maturity dates.\r\n\r\nThere happens to be a lot of Infinifi TVL maturing in the next 6 - 7 days (and more big ones mid August) and then Infinifi will be reallocating to Ethena PTs with much higher APYs (most likely).\r\n\r\nEssentially July 30th - August 14th will see a little over half of the Infinifi TVL turn over to new and higher yields ($30M+).\r\n\r\nThere’s two forms of iUSD on Pendle right now: iUSD and siUSD:\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/49aa37c7-709f-4404-91e0-ee0f8e0c8289/Screenshot_2025-07-24_203352.png?t=1753414644)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nThe iUSD YT just offers points (no yield) whereas siUSD YT offers points + yield (shown below):\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a2c02387-65bf-438a-a309-5ee353ced56c/Screenshot_2025-07-24_204012.png?t=1753414883)\r\nCaption: Note: the iUSD version gets double the points (4.5x) but no yield\r\n\r\nAt the current siUSD YT pricing, I actually think its pretty fairly priced for value of points + yield.\r\n\r\nHowever, we’ve outlined above a coming change where I think yields are about to jump materially for Infinifi and the siUSD YT will likely lag that coming move. \r\n\r\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see the yield on these siUSD YTs jump by 3% which could have a material impact on the YT pricing.\r\n\r\nNot financial advice, but one could make the case that siUSD YTs could be a value right now ahead of this major rollover for Infinifi 👀 \r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nHere’s what the top yield markets on [Pendle ](https://www.pendle.finance/)look like across Stables, BTC and ETH:\r\n\r\n**Stables**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/bf45569d-d804-4a8d-bceb-e03f76b36aa9/Screenshot_2025-07-24_184009.png?t=1753407673)\r\nCaption: 16.33% - 21.15%\r\n\r\n**BTC**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/831e12f1-35a1-4685-9e3c-e23f55cd83d3/Screenshot_2025-07-24_184028.png?t=1753407692)\r\nCaption: 2.35% - 3.65%\r\n\r\n**ETH**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/852d0919-3b5a-46f4-a97a-c3eebb6aac6b/Screenshot_2025-07-24_184047.png?t=1753407706)\r\nCaption: 4.42% - 7.66%\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n## **Leverage Looping Yields**\r\n\r\n_Looping can be a very effective leverage strategy to earn more yield, but one must be cautious to monitor borrowing rates, and liquidations which are a necessary cost to generate such leveraged yields (we don’t recommend max leverage). It’s also important to know if you’re going after points or real yield when looping._\r\n\r\nOK this loop below combines two great protocols. It utilizes [Fluid ](https://fluid.io/dashboard/1)under the hood and [Rumpel ](https://www.rumpel.xyz/)to give an extra boost. \r\n\r\nBasically Rumpel takes the extra Ethena points yield and converts it to USDC yield rather than points.\r\n\r\nFor example, I’ve included an image of a sUSDe x GHO loop on Fluid below that’s yielding an impressive **64.49% Max APY**:\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2a92a442-41fb-4ea3-84eb-421b92fee2c2/Screenshot_2025-07-24_184648.png?t=1753408021)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nThe above loop also comes with Ethena points, but these aren’t instantly redeemable unless of course you do all of this through Rumpel. \r\n\r\nIf you do this same loop via Rumpel you can stream those points into USDC and thus have a more bankable APY. In this instance you get almost **10% more APY at 74.79%**:\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f75735b4-d1ff-470d-8ab2-503403631086/Screenshot_2025-07-24_182957.png?t=1753408239)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1441c1ea-5c4d-4c41-b9d8-b79559020e56/Screenshot_2025-07-24_185149.png?t=1753408333)\r\nCaption: Here’s what that breakdown looks like\r\n\r\nThe combination of Rumpel x Fluid is very synergistic and powerful. Especially for those of you that want to bank all your yield sooner rather than waiting many months in some cases. \r\n\r\nThat’s all for now, thanks for checking it out!\r\n\r\n* _Follow Nomatic on X (Twitter) __[here](https://twitter.com/Nomaticcap)_\r\n\r\n* _Follow DeFi Dad on X ( Twitter) __[here](http://x.com/defi_dad)_\r\n\r\n* _Subscribe to The Edge Podcast __[here](https://linktr.ee/edge_pod)_\r\n\r\n* _Watch The Edge Podcast on YouTube __[here](https://youtube.com/@defidad)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
