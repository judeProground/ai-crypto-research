Three days later, on July 14, $BTC had another wave of short squeeze to $123k, which marked the local top for now.\r\nSince then, $BTC has been trading in a range between $117k and $120k, and the strength in the market has rotated to ETH and to altcoins. One of the reasons for the BTC price stalling is that an old whale holding 80k $BTC has reactivated its wallets, and ended up transferring all of them to Galaxy Digital. Right now, Galaxy Digital still holds 45k BTC in their wallets, so we can imagine that they sold almost half of the 80k $BTC (almost worth $10bn), but I don’t know what their plans are for these remaining 45k.\r\n$MSTR and many of the BTC treasury companies continue to accumulate BTC on a weekly basis, but the frenzy in stocks has now gone to ETH and alt treasury companies. $DJT has announced that they have accumulated roughly $2bn worth of $BTC. $MSTR, which has been trading sideways, has announced the launch of a new preferred product called $STRC, which is basically a 9% APR stablecoin with monthly payments. It’s been announced today that the offering will be upsized from $500M initially to $2bn. Cantor Equity Partners also announced a new SPAC with Adam Back, who is going to provide 30k BTC into the vehicle to become a BTC treasury company.\r\n$ETH treasury companies are pushing it to $3800\r\nThe main narrative of the past 2 weeks has been the massive $ETH run from $2600 to almost $3800. ETHBTC managed to not go down on the several $BTC ATH breaks until $123k, and then it’s been ETH time. It went up +27% from $3000 to $3800 in 5 days, with very limited drawdowns.\r\nThe reason for this strength is that the institutional bid has finally appeared, with both ETFs buying meaningful amounts of ETH on a daily basis (several days at $400M+ daily inflows, even more than the BTC inflows on some days), as well as the ETH treasury companies.\r\nThe main ETH treasury company is $SBET (Sharplink Gaming), and they have entered a reflexive loop in early July, as SBET is seen as a levered bet on ETH, but in the same time, SBET pumping enables the team to sell newly issued SBET shares into the market and then to buy $ETH with the proceeds, creating ETH buying pressure as a consequence. SBET pumped almost 5x bottom to top in 2 weeks, which gave plenty of room for the team to sell SBET and buy ETH. The max amount they purchased in one week is $400M, which is significant. The current mNAV of SBET is still 2.3 after the recent dip, which probably means they will keep selling BET to buy ETH until the SBET/ETH ratio goes lower.\r\nThe second largest ETH treasury company is BitMine (ticker BMNR), and it’s lead by Tom Lee. They have announced a week ago that they were holding more than $1bn in $ETH, just 10 days after closing their initial private placement of $250M. They are also funding their purchases with ATM offerings (ie issuing new BMNR shares and selling them).\r\nFinally, a third company (which will be called the Ether Machine) is planning to do the same, and to start with a $1.5bn war chest worth of $ETH.\r\nThe future Chairman of the company, Andrew Keys, will provide $650M worth of $ETH, and it’s unclear whether the remaining will be provided in-kind by the initial investors, or if they will be bought on the open market. I have written a long tweet to explain how the altcoin treasury companies can be a grift, and can be risky to buy as a retail investor, so be aware of that.\r\n$ETH being strong naturally helped push a few “ETH beta coins” up, especially on the DeFi side, with a 2x on $CRV, $FXS and $CVX. $ENA also pumped +125% bottom to top, but the last leg of the pump was probably explained by the frontrunning of the announcement of an $ENA treasury company launch. The company will be called StablecoinX and trade under the ticker $USDE. Once again, be careful when you are buying altcoin treasury companies.\r\n$XRP new highs and dino coins pump\r\n$ETH being strong is by far the best bull case for altcoins, and that’s why the ETHBTC pump has been accompanied by a meaningful altcoin strength for 2 weeks. One of the strongest sectors, has been, once again (surprisingly to me), dino coins…\r\n$XRP has even been able to reach a new cycle high at $3.66, close its 2017/2018 ATH. The other largest “USA dino coins” have also done very well : $XLM 2x’d in a week, $HBAR had a +80% pump, +60% for $ADA, almost 2x for $ALGO and $XTZ.\r\n$PENGU, memecoins and NFTs\r\nThe second strongest category has been memecoins, which is often the case during risk-on szn. $SPX has quietly reached a new ATH at $2bn MC, $FARTCOIN has been crawling up to $1.7bn, $FLOKI had a +16% pump. $DOGE, the father of memecoins, has performed impressively well, with a +70% pump in two weeks. One of the catalysts for that strength is the launch of a DOGE treasury company with the ticker BTOG…\r\nBut the best-performing memecoin of this season has been $PENGU, which went up 12x from bottom to top, with a vertical acceleration at the end. As I posted on Twitter, the market likes Schelling points, and this leads outperformers to have really outlier returns.\r\nThe $PENGU pump revived the NFT sector too, with the floor prices of the largest collections rising, as well as outperformance on the few “NFT coins” in the market, namely $DOOD, $ANIME and $BLUR.\r\nThe $PUMP debacle\r\nThe $PUMP (pumpfun) public ICO took place on July 12, it sold out in less than 10 minutes ($600M raise iirc, at $4bn FDV). The TGE happened 2 days later and the price action has been underwhelming to say the least. The team started to randomly buy back the token which lead to an initial pump to almost $7bn FDV, but since then it’s been basically down only with all the people trying to buy the dip getting punished. Yesterday, the founder Alon had a livestream with Threadguy, and since he did not announce anything that was particularly promising, the token sold off even more, and even dipped below $3bn FDV…\r\nNew coins pumping : $ZORA, $SPK\r\nOne of the top performer of this risk-on szn has been $ZORA, the socialfi/launchpad platform on Base, which went up almost 8x from bottom to top after several weeks of flattening.\r\nA similar move happened on $SPK (Spark, the Maker/Sky lending subDAO), which had a 5x pump in literally 2 days, and destroyed a lot of shorts on the way up.\r\n$SPK being this strong lead to a few pumps on other “new coins”, such as for example $SAHARA, $NEWT, $C (Chainbase) or $ERA (Caldera). Most of these are very low float, which makes them prime candidates for short squeezes, so be very careful when you short “new coins”.\r\nWhat else happened in the altcoin market ?\r\n$HYPE reached a new ATH at almost $50 on July 14, and 2 days later a new HYPE treasury company (ticker $SONN) got announced. It is very likely that people frontran the announcement quite hard, because HYPE has been underperforming since then, and is currently trading around $43.\r\n$CFX, the “Chinese Ethereum”, went up +230% in two weeks before giving back -25%.\r\n$IP is surprisingly strong, it’s currently trading at $5.3bn FDV, which is massive, and it actually looks like it will squeeze the shorts again… Be careful with this one, it’s a crime coin in my opinion.\r\n$BANANAS31 has been down only since its massive spike and squeeze to $800M mcap, it’s been a great short, but is now flattening.\r\nLast week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins and was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025, while also passing the CLARITY Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for digital assets and was sent to the Senate for further consideration.\r\nThank you for reading this article,\r\nCheers,\r\nViktor [ https://substack.com/redirect/354dd697-dac3-4145-9b53-d09400c24d0a?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZxdTAzIn0.8gObup55391UiysY1BATCN5wRc6MUJZaZgak5YGfZYw ].\r\nRef link shill : The sniper I use to trade coins on Solana is Axiom [ https://substack.com/redirect/1598cc5c-37e3-4622-9555-6753f4b0a27f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZxdTAzIn0.8gObup55391UiysY1BATCN5wRc6MUJZaZgak5YGfZYw ].
