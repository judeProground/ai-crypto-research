  "body": "**Why this report matters**\r\n\r\nAltcoins are quietly collapsing under the weight of $59 billion in token unlocks, yet few traders are paying attention. Retail interest has waned, volumes have plummeted, and the narratives that once drove hype have all but vanished. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to attract capital, with ETF inflows painting a stark contrast to the relentless outflows from altcoin ecosystems. Even the most celebrated meme coins are unraveling, leaving retail investors stuck at the top. But buried in the data are subtle signals—patterns that have historically preceded short-term rallies.\r\n\r\n**Main argument**\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why altcoins are underperforming this cycle, and, with few exceptions, have resulted mainly in investors losing money. Since [January 14, 2024](https://update.10xresearch.com/p/are-smart-traders-hedging-bitcoin-with-altcoin-shorts), we’ve consistently recommended shorting altcoins while maintaining long exposure to Bitcoin. Year-to-date, Bitcoin is up 17%, while Solana and Ethereum have declined by 20% and 22%, respectively, meaning Bitcoin has outperformed them by roughly 37%. In other words, it’s been a highly effective long/short strategy.\r\n\r\n**Performance of 140 crypto currencies - year to date**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1effba9d-8cdf-42a4-8592-4b042b69b088/image.png?t=1751853168)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nMarket Updates\r\n\r\nBecome a paying subscriber of Market Updates to get access to this post and other subscriber-only content.\r\n\r\nUpgrade: https://update.10xresearch.com/upgrade\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
