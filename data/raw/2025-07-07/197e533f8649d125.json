The wallets originally received BTC in 2011 when prices were under $4/ BTC. \r\n\r\n* Two wallets got **20K BTC** in April 2011, when BTC traded at **$0.78**. At the time, that was worth only **$15K**. Today, the same coins are valued at about **$2.18B**. \r\n\r\n* Six more wallets received **60K BTC** on May 4, 2011, when the price had climbed to **$3.37**. Back then, that was worth around **$202K,** now over** $6.52B**.\r\n\r\n* Recently, all 8 wallets moved their BTC, transferring the full 80K BTC to new modern addresses that help reduce transaction fees and improve privacy.\r\n\r\n**Addresses involved:**\r\n\r\n* 1KbrSKrT3GeEruTuuYYUSQ35JwKbrAWJYm\r\n\r\n* 12tLs9c9RsALt4ockxa1hB4iTCTSmxj2me\r\n\r\n* 1P1iThxBH542Gmk1kZNXyji4E4iwpvSbrt\r\n\r\n* 1CPaziTqeEixPoSFtJxu74uDGbpEAotZom\r\n\r\n* 1f1miYFQWTzdLiCBxtHHnNiW7WAWPUccr\r\n\r\n* 1BAFWQhH9pNkz3mZDQ1tWrtKkSHVCkc3fV\r\n\r\n* 14YK4mzJGo5NKkNnmVJeuEAQftLt795Gec\r\n\r\n* 1ucXXZQSEf4zny2HRwAQKtVpkLPTUKRtt\r\n\r\nOnchain analysts believe a single entity controls all eight wallets. So far, the new receiving addresses have not moved any Bitcoin again. The owner‚Äôs identity and reasons for moving such a massive fortune remain unknown.\r\n\r\n**Our take:** BTC as an asset is mature enough that such large movements don‚Äôt spook the market as much. There‚Äôs enough liquidity and excitement around the asset to absorb the potential sell pressure.\r\n\r\n**For builders and investors: **Nothing much.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ee9530b4-5ac4-4ca0-88e3-1bd3b03292ad/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**PRODUCT OF THE WEEK**\r\n\r\n## **ETH Strategy‚Äôs Leveraged ETH Without Liquidation**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/195ee88a-efa3-4c81-9c83-0fb512860cec/image.png?t=1751864440)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nETH Strategy is a DeFi protocol that offers **leveraged exposure to Ethereum** without the usual risks of liquidations or volatility decay. It does this by issuing **convertible bonds**, where users deposit stablecoins and receive debt tokens plus NFT options. \r\n\r\n* The protocol uses these funds to buy ETH for its on-chain treasury.\r\n\r\n* Holders of STRAT tokens get leveraged ETH exposure and can borrow ETH from the treasury using STRAT as collateral. \r\n\r\n* This setup grows the treasury, generates yield, and avoids interest costs by embedding conversion rights in the debt.\r\n\r\n**Key Components:**\r\n\r\n* **STRAT:** A leverage token tied to ETH\r\n\r\n* **CDT:** A debt token\r\n\r\n* **NFT Options:** Convertible rights to STRAT\r\n\r\nIn short, ETH Strategy is a decentralized way to get high-beta ETH exposure securely and transparently.\r\n\r\n**Other cool products: **\r\n\r\n* [Cluster Yield](https://clusteryield.com/), an AI trading platform. \r\n\r\n* [IntentX](https://intentx.io/), an OTC derivatives exchange.\r\n\r\n* [Mitosis](https://mitosis.org/), a network for programmable liquidity.\r\n\r\n* [INIT Capital](https://init.capital/), a Liquidity Hook Money Market platform.\r\n\r\n* [INDX](https://indx.app/), an on-chain platform for crypto traded funds (CTFs) on Base.\r\n\r\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.
