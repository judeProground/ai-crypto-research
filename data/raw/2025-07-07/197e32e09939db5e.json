Ceasefire optimism in the Middle East and traction on the Geneva trade agreement tempered early spikes in oil and gold, while soft CPI and PCE prints alongside a split Fed dot plot sent real yields lower and risk assets higher. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at new all-time highs, and the 10Y Treasury rallied from 4.5% to below 4.2% as markets leaned into a Q3 cut. Despite the swirl of headline risk, volatility compressed across the board: equity skew, rate vol, and FX ranges all narrowed materially into quarter-end.\r\n\r\nCrypto traded tactically and without clear directional conviction. BTC briefly pushed through $110k on 10 June, buoyed by steady ETF inflows and corporate treasury headlines, but the move failed to stick. Spot faded back into the $107k range by month-end, mirroring a broader pause across majors. ETH initially extended its ETF-fuelled rally to highs above $2,800 but retraced steadily into quarter-end, closing around $2,400. The ETHBTC cross gave back most of its May gains, reversing from 0.026 to sub-0.023, and timezone returns were more balanced than the previous month (Figure 1.2a/b).\r\n\r\nStructural flows offered little support. BTC options briefly flipped to call-heavy positioning early in the month before reverting, while ETH saw persistent strangle and call spread selling. Skew and risk reversals flattened out (Figures 5.2, 5.3), and implied vols saw a mild compression on the month across tenors (Figure 5.5). ETH 1M IVs, which spiked above 70v mid-month, retreated to the low 60s, while BTC 1M implieds trended into the high 30s. Neither the $15B BTC options expiry on 28 June nor ETH ETF approvals materially repriced risk. Basis remained healthy, with Sep BTC futures closing near 5% annualised (Figure 3.4a), and funding remained neutral to modestly positive (Figure 3.3). Liquidations in perpetual futures were notable, with multiple $200MM days on both the long and short sides, including some $500MM long liquidations (Figure 4.2).\r\n\r\nOverall, June marked a reset in positioning and volatility. Spot flows cooled, option demand turned defensive, and the vol surface flattened. Crypto held firm but lacked the conviction of May’s trend breakout.\r\n\r\nSubscribe (https://presto.beehiiv.com/subscribe)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n### About Presto Research Offerings\r\n\r\n* **Daily Market Brief **is issued every 9AM SGT on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.
