The platform offered 15% of its total 1T token supply at $0.004 per token, giving the project an FDV of **$4B**. \r\n\r\n* The website initially stated only **12.5%** of the tokens were available to the public, but co-founder Alon Cohen clarified that the entire **15%** allocation was sold.\r\n\r\nThe sale was conducted across multiple exchanges, including Bybit, which reported its offering was oversubscribed due to an API delay and promised refunds to users who did not receive tokens. \r\n\r\n* Pumpfun plans to explore utility options for PUMP, such as fee rebates and token buybacks, and is considering sharing protocol revenue with holders. \r\n\r\n**Our take:** PumpFun has a P/E ratio of ~5.7 ($4B FDV divided by $700M in fees), but unlike traditional equities you don’t really “own” the PumpFun team/company and acquiring 51% of PUMP doesn’t mean that you’re now the UBO that’s in charge of deciding where the $700M in fees goes too. Thus, the buyback mechanism is the next best thing we have. Extrapolating on the 25% number, that gets us to ~$175M in annual buyback pressure.\r\n\r\nI don’t believe this number is enough to offset the sell pressure from the ICOs, existing investors, and team members. Unlike HYPE, only 25% instead of 97% of the protocol fee is going to be used in token buybacks. While there might be upside because of the lack of tokens to bid, the gap between $4B FDV and $40B FDV is simply caused by the higher selling pressure and lower buying pressure. Sometimes, it’s better to keep it simple, stupid.\r\n\r\n**For builders and investors: **Be careful when comparing PUMP with HYPE. There are significant differences.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ee9530b4-5ac4-4ca0-88e3-1bd3b03292ad/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**PRODUCT OF THE WEEK**\r\n\r\n## **Timefun’s Tokenized Time Marketplace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/659fed32-85ae-4ba2-96f6-9a4dce86903c/image.png?t=1752468325)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n[Timefun](https://x.com/timedotfun) has gone live on Solana, allowing creators to tokenize their time into tradable minutes. Fans can buy, sell, and redeem these minutes for direct messages, group chats, and soon voice or video calls. \r\n\r\n* All interactions happen within the platform using escrow contracts that hold the minutes until the creator responds, ensuring transparency and refunds if needed.\r\n\r\n* Each trade includes a 2% fee split among the creator, Timefun, referrers, and an award pool that distributes USDC rewards monthly to active holders. \r\n\r\n* Auctions for activities like calls can also be priced in minutes.\r\n\r\nFounder Kawz said the bigger vision is to create a new asset class where people can invest in someone early and benefit as their popularity grows. \r\n\r\n* While Timefun started on Ethereum’s Base network, it moved to Solana for faster, cheaper transactions.\r\n\r\n* At launch, buying and redeeming time is open to everyone, while selling time is permissioned to control early demand. \r\n\r\n* A native token may be introduced later to connect the ecosystem once the platform reaches broader adoption.\r\n\r\n**Other cool products: **\r\n\r\n* [TONCO](https://app.tonco.io/), a concentrated liquidity DEX on TON.\r\n\r\n* [ORA](https://www.ora.io/), a protocol for decentralized AI and data in Web3.\r\n\r\n* [Aurelius Finance](https://aurelius.finance/), a CDP-integrated lending-borrowing protocol.\r\n\r\n* [MemHustle](https://memhustle.com/), a full-scale game seamlessly integrated into Telegram.\r\n\r\n* [Atomiq](https://app.atomiq.exchange/), a trustless cross-chain swap between Bitcoin and smart chains.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.
