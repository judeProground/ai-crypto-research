  "body": "Bitcoin has seen three meaningful corrections in 2025—and we’ve called all three. \r\n\r\nThe latest pullback, though smaller, caught most off guard—except our premium subscribers, who were able to sell high, buy back lower, and generate outsized returns even in a range-bound market. We also turned bullish right on time in April and anticipated the July rally as early as late June. \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/24e503e4-f019-48f8-8b17-108fd6113d6f/image.png?t=1754106366)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWhile crypto media has picked up some of our calls, only premium subscribers received the full analysis, data, and conviction-building frameworks behind those moves. In markets like these, timing is everything—and having the right insight before the crowd can make a significant difference. Our subscribers were ahead of this week’s decline again… the only question is: will you be ahead next time?\r\n\r\nAnd guess what—we’re not just focused on Bitcoin. We’ve been writing increasingly about crypto equities too. After identifying an 88% rally in Coinbase from our May entry point, we recently shifted short based on our quant-driven fair value models—a move many of our subscribers followed. With Coinbase shares dropping 17% last night, the question now is: when do you cover and go long again? That’s where our disciplined process comes in—not only saving our subscribers time but consistently adding real value to their investment decisions.\r\n\r\n**Join our premium research now and start positioning with clarity, not guesswork.**\r\n\r\n[[Subscribe here](https://update.10xresearch.com/upgrade) ]\r\n\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
