At the July FOMC, Powell maintained a neutral tone, acknowledging softer H1 growth while offering no forward guidance. The Fed held rates steady at 5.375%, with dissenting votes from Waller and Bowman calling for a cut. Yields bull-flattened, with the 10Y Treasury falling from 4.33% to 4.19%. Credit tightened, and the dollar strengthened into a flurry of tariff developments. The White House finalised bilateral agreements with Japan, the EU, and South Korea at 15%, and announced higher rates on Brazil (50%), Canada (35%), and Mexico (30%), with India talks ongoing. Despite growing threats of retaliation, equities held up, tech earnings beat expectations, and risk appetite remained resilient into the quarter-end.\r\n\r\nCrypto surged sharply into mid-July before easing. BTC rallied from sub-$110k to a high of $123k on 14 July, finishing the month around $115k. ETH outperformed, rising from below $2,500 to a peak above $3,900, as ETF headlines and legislative momentum drove relative strength. Policy breakthroughs included the House passage of the GENIUS Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC bill. Major issuers filed ETF amendments enabling in-kind redemptions, and the SEC initiated a broader crypto regulatory overhaul. ETHBTC rose from 0.02259 to 0.03302, reclaiming March levels (_Figure 1.4_), with US hours driving most of the upside in both assets (_Figures 1.2a_/_1.2b_).\r\n\r\nVolatility rose with spot. BTC 1M implied vols peaked just under 40v mid-month before fading (_Figure 5.5a_), while ETH 1M implied touched 70v on 14 July before drifting lower into month-end (_Figure 5.5b_). Realised vols also climbed but lagged implied, keeping IV-RV spreads wide (_Figure 5.7_). Options flows reflected active structure demand: ETH call spreads traded across the Q3 and Q4 curve, BTC butterflies and risk reversals saw significant interest (_Figure 5.3_, _Figure 5.4_). Despite stretched spot levels and rising implieds, front-end basis held steady around 8% annualised (_Figure 3.4a_), and funding remained supportive (_Figure 3.3_). Perpetual liquidations rose during the rally but remained well-contained (_Figure 4.2_), while derivatives volumes stayed elevated through the month (_Figure 4.1_).\r\n\r\nBy month-end, crypto had priced in a wave of structural catalysts and policy developments. Spot faded slightly, vols reset lower, and positioning seems to be cleaner heading into August.\r\n\r\nSubscribe (https://presto.beehiiv.com/subscribe)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n### About Presto Research Offerings\r\n\r\n* **Daily Market Brief **is issued every 9AM SGT on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.
