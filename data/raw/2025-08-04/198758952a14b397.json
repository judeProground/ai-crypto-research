The GENIUS Act has probably acted as a strong catalyst for some coins, especially $ETH and $ENA for example (ETH has been shilled to tradfi by Tom Lee as the asset which will benefit from stablecoin expansion).\r\nA whale that had been holding 80k BTC for more than ten years decided to wake up in July and sell them. The first 30k batch of coins were sold through Galaxy around July 15, and it lead to a dump from $120k to $116k. The second batch was sold on July 25, and once again it brought $BTC from $119k to $115k, and then Galaxy announced that the transaction was done.\r\nOne of the main events in July has been the $PUMP TGE. The $PUMP (pumpfun) public ICO took place on July 12, it sold out in less than 10 minutes ($600M raise for retail, at $4bn FDV). The TGE happened 2 days later and the price action has been underwhelming to say the least. The team started to randomly buy back the token which lead to an initial pump to almost $7bn FDV, but after that it’s been down only, and went as low as $2.3bn FDV.\r\nOn July 30, we had an FOMC meeting, and the hawkish tone of Powell lead to a decrease in the likelihood of upcoming rate cuts, which lead to a -2% dump on $BTC that has been quickly retraced to the upside.\r\nGMX v1 got hacked for $40M+ on July 9, it lead to a -30% price decrease on $GMX in a few hours, but apparently the hacker sent the money back in exchange for a bounty.\r\nOn July, Elon Musk announced that they were bringing back “Vine, but with AI”, and it immediately pumped $VINE from $40M to $80M market cap, and then the momentum remained strong, as the coin reached $180M mcap four days later. Unsurprisingly though, it topped there, as it got clearer and clearer that the Vine brand was not going to be used, and that Elon was just teasing the launch of Grok Imagine (Grok for videos). The coin has been down only and a great short since then.\r\nEach month, a lot of new coins get launched and listed on CEXes, but maybe the most noticeable one this month has been $M (Memecore). It went up almost 7x after its listing, and reached a $5bn FDV, but with an extremely low float. It topped there and then bled down -65%. $ERA (Caldera) also got listed at almost $2bn FDV, but its price decreased by -50%.\r\nThere have been several Upbit listings in July, and almost all of them lead to huge pumps which marked a local top and were good shorts : $MOODENG (July 3), $HYPER (July 10), $RESOLV (July 11), $SYRUP (July 25), $OMNI (July 29). Another noticeable listing has been $HBAR on Robinhood on July 25, it instantly pumped +7%, reversed the whole candle, but then went up +25% in two days.\r\n$BANANAS31 has been manipulated to very awful degree, it went up slowly without a drawdown from $150m mcap to $300m, and then this culminated with an extreme short squeeze from $300M to $800M mcap. After that, it had a -90% drawdown in 2 days and was an extremely attractive short.\r\nMain narratives of July :\r\n$BTC new ATH at $123K\r\nOn July 10, $BTC convincingly broke its $112k ATH and then went straight to almost $119k by liquidating a lot of shorts. Three days later, on July 14, $BTC had another wave of short squeeze to $123k, which marked the local top for now.\r\nAfter that, $BTC has been trading in a range between $117k and $120k, and the strength in the market has rotated to ETH and to altcoins. One of the reasons for the BTC price stalling is the selling of the 80k BTC of the old whale, which culminated with a $115k local bottom on July 25.\r\nThen we had the FOMC dip to $115.8k on July 30, which was quickly bought back up. But the end of month rebalancing flows lead to a disgusting sell-off and a month close at $116k (…before going down even lower to $112K on August 2).\r\nETFs and $ETH treasury companies are pushing ETH to almost $4000\r\nThe main narrative of the month has been the massive $ETH run from $2600 to almost $4000. ETHBTC managed to not go down on the several $BTC ATH breaks until $123k, and then it’s been ETH time. It went up +27% from $3000 to $3800 in 5 days, with very limited drawdowns.\r\nThe reason for this strength is that the institutional bid has finally appeared, with both ETFs buying meaningful amounts of ETH on a daily basis (several days at $400M+ daily inflows, even more than the BTC inflows on some days), as well as the ETH treasury companies.\r\nThe two main ETH treasury companies are Sharplink Gaming ($SBET, lead by Joe Lubin) and BitMine ($BMNR, lead by Tom Lee). Together, these 2 companies bought almost 1M $ETH in July, ie something like a $2bn-$3bn but pressure.\r\nThe chart of $SBET show the clear effect of reflexivity, as it went up almost 5x in two weeks, before having a -60% drawdown. Whenever SBET has a large enough premium to NAV, they issue and sell new shares to buy ETH with the proceeds, which both means that $ETH will get inflows when SBET goes up, and that it won’t get them when SBET goes down. $BMNR has a more surprising chart, because it’s been trading almost flat for the most part in July, despite selling a lot of $BMNR shares into the market (to purchase ETH).\r\nA third company (which will be called the Ether Machine) is planning to do the same, and to start with a $1.5bn war chest worth of $ETH. There is also a fourth one that will be called Ethzilla.\r\n$ETH topped at $3940 on July 28, and then had initiated 5 days of downward price action, with the ETH treasury companies seemingly struggling in terms of price. But I don’t think the ETH tco mania is over, I think we are at least going to have a second leg, given how much inflows we suddenly got from tradfi into ETH in July. I can’t see it stop suddenly after just a few weeks.\r\n$ETH being strong naturally helped push a few “ETH beta coins” up, especially on the DeFi side, with a 2x on $CRV, $FXS and $CVX.\r\nDino coins and new $XRP highs\r\n$ETH being strong is by far the best bull case for altcoins, and that’s why the ETHBTC pump has been accompanied by a meaningful altcoin strength for 2 weeks. One of the strongest sectors, has been, once again (surprisingly to me), dino coins…\r\n$XRP has even been able to reach a new cycle high at $3.66, close its 2017/2018 ATH. The other largest “USA dino coins” have also done very well : $XLM 2x’d in a week, $HBAR had a +80% pump, +60% for $ADA, almost 2x for $ALGO and $XTZ.\r\nMemecoins strength : $PENGU $SPX $BONK\r\nUnsurprisingly as we’ve had 2 to 3 weeks of risk-on price action, memecoins have been outperforming as a sector.\r\nThe strongest ones have been :\r\n$PENGU, absolutely unstoppable, it went up 3x in July and 12x from its April lows. These kind of pumps act as reflexive loops which makes the coin become a Schelling point.\r\n$BONK, up +200% during the first half of July, as a consequence of letsbonkfun capturing the majority of the launchpad volume.\r\n$SPX, quietly up 2x to $2.3bn market cap. The Murad effect is strong, and SPX is an ETH meme so it benefits from the positive ETH price action.\r\n$MOG, it pumped from $1 to $2 in July, and it’s also a coin that tends to act as an ETH high beta coin.\r\n$DOGE had a +70% in three weeks, despite its size.\r\n$FLOKI 2x’d too.\r\nThe $PENGU pump revived the NFT sector too, with the floor prices of the largest collections rising, as well as outperformance on the few “NFT coins” in the market, namely $DOOD, $ANIME and $BLUR.\r\n“DAT summer” : altcoin treasury companies\r\nJuly has definitely been the month of altcoin treasury companies (or DAT / digital asset treasuries), first with the ETH treasury companies buying spree, and then wiht a few announcements of altcoin vehicles : $HYPE, $DOGE, $ENA, $SUI and $BNB. Usually what happens is that they are heavily frontrun, and then tend to sell off after the post-announcement spike. The only ones that became strong during the days after the announcement have been $DOGE and $ENA though.\r\nThe $ENA treasury company, StablecoinX, has started a daily purchase program of $ENA on the open market, which explains the strength of the underlying. But you have to be aware of the fact that some of these treasury companies (not all!) are grifty vehicles that are used to offload locked tokens.

It topped at $2bn FDV.\r\n$SPK being this strong lead to a few pumps on other “new coins”, such as for example $SAHARA, $NEWT, $C (Chainbase) or $ERA (Caldera). Most of these are very low float, which made them prime candidates for short squeezes. These “laggard” squeezes did only last 1 or 2 days though, and were actually a good signal that you had to start getting defensive on altcoins.\r\nBest-performer list :\r\nBest-performers among large caps in July :\r\nPENGU : +129%\r\nENA : +114%\r\nIP : +104%\r\nCRV : +80%\r\nBONK : +80%\r\nCRO : +71%\r\nXLM : +68%\r\nHBAR : +68%\r\nETH : +49%\r\nALGO : +32%\r\nXRP : +35%\r\nSPX : +35%\r\nSmaller coins worth noting that had a good performance in July :\r\nZORA : +650%\r\nGP : 20X\r\nDOLO : +286%\r\nHYPER : +283%\r\nREKT : +228%\r\nCFX : +189%\r\nOMNI : +182%\r\nSPK : +130%\r\nCVX : +78%\r\nSAROS : +66%\r\nKTA : +64%\r\nCKB : +58%\r\nZBCN : +48%\r\nFXS : +47%\r\nThank you for reading this article,\r\nCheers,\r\nViktor [ https://substack.com/redirect/9c594de1-a5ba-40a9-bfbb-bc68dca4193f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZxdTAzIn0.8gObup55391UiysY1BATCN5wRc6MUJZaZgak5YGfZYw ].\r\nRef link shill : The sniper I use to trade coins on Solana is Axiom [ https://substack.com/redirect/d273db24-284a-4fd6-a111-292515cc85b8?j=eyJ1IjoiNXZxdTAzIn0.8gObup55391UiysY1BATCN5wRc6MUJZaZgak5YGfZYw ].
