July ended with record highs and surging volumes, but August opened with ETF outflows and layoffs. Momentum remains strong, yet so does volatility.

Prioritize assets with strong backing, and watch how crypto ties into sovereign debt markets.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ee9530b4-5ac4-4ca0-88e3-1bd3b03292ad/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**PRODUCT OF THE WEEK**\r\n\r\n## **Concreteâ€™s AUSD Yield Vault on Katana**\r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/ConcreteXYZ/status/1951266696087421145)\r\n\r\nConcrete has [introduced](https://x.com/ConcreteXYZ/status/1951266696087421145) a new institutional-grade yield vault for $AUSD holders on the Katana platform. \r\n\r\n* The vault allocates AUSD across on-chain strategies to generate real yield, with no lockups and active capital management. \r\n\r\n* Backed 1:1 by fiat via Agora Reserves, AUSD deposits earn $KAT rewards, ecosystem incentives, LP yield, and Concrete Points. \r\n\r\n* The vault is secured by audited smart contracts from Zellic and Halborn.\r\n\r\n**Other cool products: **\r\n\r\n* [Interport](https://app.interport.fi/), a cross-chain hub.\r\n\r\n* [Orbit-chain](https://bridge.orbitchain.io/), a multi-asset blockchain.\r\n\r\n* [ANOME](https://www.anome.xyz/), a fully on-chain PvP card game.\r\n\r\n* [GemPad](https://gempad.app/), a multi-chain decentralized launchpad.\r\n\r\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.

The $1B ETF outflows suggest traders were quick to lock in profits, especially outside of BlackRockâ€™s funds.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6e5364b7-abf8-4bda-a332-99537a4e101a/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**QUICK BITES**\r\n\r\n* **Crypto exchange volume** [surged](https://www.theblock.co/post/365325/us-crypto-etfs-open-august-with-largest-outflows-in-months-following-record-breaking-july) to $1.71T in July.\r\n\r\n* **Lido** [lays off ](https://www.theblock.co/post/365369/lido-lay-off)15% of workforce for 'long-term sustainability.'\r\n\r\n* **US crypto ETFs** [open](https://www.theblock.co/post/365325/us-crypto-etfs-open-august-with-largest-outflows-in-months-following-record-breaking-july) August with largest outflows in months.\r\n\r\n* **Metaplanet** [buys](https://www.theblock.co/post/365359/metaplanet-buys-54-million-bitcoin) $54M worth of BTC, maintains 7th place globally.\r\n\r\n* **UK regulator** [to allow](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/03/uk-regulator-to-allow-retail-investors-access-to-crypto-etns-in-october) retail investors access to crypto ETNs in October.\r\n\r\n* **Trump Media** [confirms](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/03/trump-media-confirms-usd2b-bitcoin-treasury-and-usd300m-options-strategy-in-q2-2025-earnings-report) $2B BTC Treasury and $300M Options Strategy.\r\n\r\n* **Crypto Task Force** [will tour](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/02/sec-s-crypto-task-force-will-tour-u-s-to-hear-from-small-startups-on-policy-reform) US to hear from small startups on policy reform.\r\n\r\n* **Coinbase** [slides](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/04/coinbase-slides-nearly-20-in-worst-weekly-performance-since-september-2024) nearly 20% in the worst weekly performance since Sept 2024.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/194501e0-c251-4dca-a312-6e1d5e6e0a26/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**NOTEWORTHY READS & MEME**\r\n\r\n* **Fishyâ€™s **[read](https://x.com/f_s_y_y/status/1950181028301054389) on DAT trackers.\r\n\r\n* **Four Pillarâ€™s **[read](https://x.com/FourPillarsFP/status/1950477919400403140) on [Issue] $HYPErprinter go brrrrrr.\r\n\r\n* **John Wangâ€™s **[read](https://x.com/j0hnwang/status/1950277258981364129) on The Engineered Economy of Roblox.\r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/fejau_inc/status/1951346831646208052)\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ccbcdb05-f111-44c8-b65c-2e30d84cec0f/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy reading this issue, please consider subscribing.
