Wurster emphasized that Schwab clients already hold **over** **20%** of all crypto ETFs in the industry.\r\n\r\n* Wurster also says that their clients are eager to consolidate crypto holdings from \"digital native\" platforms under Schwab's management.\r\n\r\n* The move follows the relaxation of crypto restrictions by US banking regulators in 2025, allowing institutions to offer crypto services without prior approval. \r\n\r\n* Schwab already provides access to Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, crypto-themed mutual funds, and Bitcoin options. \r\n\r\n* The firm currently manages **$10.8T in assets**, with crypto making up around **$25B** of that.\r\n\r\n* Wurster said Schwab aims to compete directly with exchanges like Coinbase by giving clients a trusted platform to buy and custody crypto assets.\r\n\r\n**Other cool products: **\r\n\r\n* [Veax](https://app.veax.com/), a DEX on Near Protocol. \r\n\r\n* [FIVA](https://www.thefiva.com/), a yield tokenization protocol on Telegram. \r\n\r\n* [BinaryX](https://www.binaryx.pro/), a play-and-earn GameFi & IGO platform.\r\n\r\n* [Thales](https://thalesmarket.io/), a liquidity & settlement layer for prediction markets.\r\n\r\n* [UTONIC](https://utonic.org/), a revenue-sharing restaking layer on TON and Telegram.\r\n\r\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.

Bitcoin](https://www.theblock.co/post/363489/uk-home-office-working-towards-sale-of-7-billion-seized-btc-stockpile-the-telegraph), reportedly worth at least **$7B** based on a 2018 seizure of **61,000 BTC **linked to a Chinese Ponzi scheme. \r\n\r\n* While victims are requesting the return of funds, the Crown Prosecution Service has asked the High Court for permission to retain the assets, which could then be transferred to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n* Chancellor Rachel Reeves, facing a budget shortfall, has expressed interest in leveraging seized crypto assets and in improving crypto regulations to foster fintech growth. \r\n\r\n* Meanwhile, the UK is offering a $53.7M, four-year contract to manage and liquidate seized digital assets, but has yet to receive suitable bids. \r\n\r\n* Legal timelines may delay the sale by up to four years in complex cases.\r\n\r\n**Our take: **Government tends to sell directly so this is one to watch.\r\n\r\nView image:
