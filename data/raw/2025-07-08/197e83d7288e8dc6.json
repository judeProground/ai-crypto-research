As the stablecoin narrative continued, Ethereum stood out in absolute USD TVL growth (Figure 2b).\r\n\r\n* Veda, a multichain yield vault which announced an $18MM Series A last month, showed impressive outperformance in both percentage and absolute USD terms of TVL growth (Figure 3a/b).\r\n\r\n* The stablecoin metrics tell a similar story to that of TVL growth, with the percentage regression standing out more than the growth: here, Sonic and Berachain both show up in the bottom 2 chains (Figure 4a). Despite seeing a notable TVL decline, Tron’s status as the leading stabecoin chain continued as it surpassed Ethereum in June for the net stablecoin USD change (Figure 4b).\r\n\r\n* Surprisingly given previous data, Base and Ethereum saw outflowing bridging, with the latter showing a significant decline, while Arbitrum experienced notable outperformance (Figure 5a).\r\n\r\n* Protocol fee growth was extremely skewed with BSC leading for a second consecutive month, whilst other chains saw a mix in activity - Bitcoin trailed with the largest decline, after having the second highest growth in May (Figure 6a).\r\n\r\nRead full report (https://www.prestolabs.io/research/state-of-adoption-june-2025)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n### About Presto Research Offerings\r\n\r\n* **Daily Market Brief** is issued every 9AM SGT on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. _Daily mailing distribution is limited to select media._\r\n\r\n* **Presto Originals** provides key insights into the latest market trends.\r\n\r\n* **Trade Ideas** discusses timely and non-consensus trading ideas with in-depth analysis.\r\n\r\n* **Crypto Focus **gives an overview of blockchain technology, protocols, and other hot issues shaping the crypto industry.\r\n\r\n* **Data Focus** covers on & off-chain data analysis to explore topics that spark curiosity or controversy.\r\n\r\n* **Interview Series** features candid discussion with Web3 industry founders.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nFor speaker engagements, trading commentary, subscription to Daily Market Brief or any other PR related inquires, please contact: Thomas ([thomas@prestolabs.io](mailto:thomas@prestolabs.io) or @thomas_presto on Telegram)\r\n\r\nPresto Research is also available on [Telegram channel](https://t.me/presto_research).\r\n\r\nHas this been helpful?
