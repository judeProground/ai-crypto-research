As trading activity shifts and user behavior fragments, the fee model powering this platform could reshape how early-stage tokens are discovered and traded. Meanwhile, its on-chain rival is scrambling to defend turf with a new product launch. \r\n\r\n**Pump.fun token launches sharply dropped off after $TRUMP launch**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c2c9a959-0875-4f4b-89da-571b89cded34/image.png?t=1751955900)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nValuations are beginning to diverge, and revenue multiples suggest a potential bargain—or a trap. What started as a symbiotic partnership has now evolved into a high-stakes rivalry for dominance over the next wave of retail crypto transactions. We break down the numbers, the tokenomics, and why this battle could matter far beyond Solana.\r\n\r\n**Main argument**\r\n\r\nPump.fun’s native PUMP token is scheduled to launch via a public sale on July 12, 2025, running for approximately 72 hours. The sale will be hosted on Gate.com and Pump.fun’s own platform, offering 150 billion PUMP tokens (15% of the total 1 trillion supply) at $0.004 each, valuing the project at roughly $4 billion. As a reference, Raydium’s fully diluted valuation is $1.2 billion but _**there is a twist. Pump.fun is either a bargain or a trap.**_\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nMarket Updates\r\n\r\nBecome a paying subscriber of Market Updates to get access to this post and other subscriber-only content.\r\n\r\nUpgrade: https://update.10xresearch.com/upgrade\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
