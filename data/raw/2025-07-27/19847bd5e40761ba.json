And for the first time, it was Ethereum inflows that [dominated over Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/331906/ethereum-etfs-massively-outpace-bitcoin-funds).\r\n\r\nEthereum spot funds in the U.S. added more than $1.8 billion worth of assets this week, per data from Farside Investors, while the Bitcoin funds only added about $70 million.
