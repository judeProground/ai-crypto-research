Within a week, stablecoin supply [surged by $4B](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-legislation-4b-surge-stablecoin-supply), pushing the total market cap **above $264B**. \r\n\r\n* Major financial institutions, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, have announced plans to launch stablecoin offerings under the new framework.\r\n\r\n* Industry analysts say the GENIUS Act could boost US dollar dominance globally by reinforcing trust in dollar-backed digital assets. \r\n\r\n* The bill also serves as a foundation for broader crypto regulation, with lawmakers now focusing on comprehensive market structure legislation. \r\n\r\n**What’s Next: **The Senate is expected to act by September 30.\r\n\r\n**Why it Matters:** The GENIUS Act brings long-awaited regulatory clarity to stablecoins, unlocking institutional participation and setting the stage for broader US crypto policy.\r\n\r\n**Our Take:** The real test will be how effectively regulators implement the law and whether future legislation can balance innovation with systemic safeguards. \r\n\r\n* For now, it’s a clear signal: US crypto policy is finally moving beyond headlines into structured action.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0527dc80-ade1-46a8-8bce-b259d4df58aa/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**GLOBAL LEGAL ROUNDUP**\r\n\r\n### **America:**\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲 **US** [may charge](https://www.theblock.co/post/364330/dragonfly-exec-says-us-government-is-considering-charges-against-the-venture-firm-for-its-early-support-of-tornado-cash) Dragonfly over Tornado Cash ties.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** US DOJ **[drops](http://v) probe into Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** US crypto legislation** [drives](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-legislation-4b-surge-stablecoin-supply) $4B surge in stablecoin supply.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** SEC** [explores](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-ethereum-tokenized-securities-standard) Ethereum token standard for compliant securities.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** Senate Republicans** [release](https://www.theblock.co/post/363815/senate-republicans-release-crypto-market-structure-discussion-draft-aimed-at-building-off-house-passed-clarity-bill) crypto market structure discussion draft.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** FTX** [to begin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-distribute-1-9-billion-court-approval-cut-disputed-claims) $1.9B payouts in September as claims no longer disputed.\r\n\r\n### **Europe:**\r\n\r\n* 🇪🇺 **CoinShares** [secures](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/23/crypto-asset-manager-coinshares-secures-eu-wide-mica-license) EU-Wide MiCA license.\r\n\r\n### **Middle East & Africa**\r\n\r\n* 🇬🇭** Ghana **[plans](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/24/ghana-plans-crypto-firm-licensing-in-response-to-growing-demand-bloomberg) crypto firm licensing in response to growing demand.\r\n\r\n* 🇳🇬** Nigeria **[opens doors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-opens-doors-to-stablecoin-firms-under-regulatory-oversight) to stablecoin firms under regulatory oversight.\r\n\r\n### **APAC:**\r\n\r\n* 🇦🇺** Australian fintech Finder** [wins](https://cointelegraph.com/news/finder-wins-asic-crypto-yield-case) court battle over crypto yield product.\r\n\r\n* 🇭🇰** Hong Kong** [to criminalize](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-stablecoin-law-august-2025) unlicensed stablecoin promotions from Aug. 1.\r\n\r\n* 🇰🇷** S.

While the SEC is exploring an “innovation exception,” Citadel is calling for a cautious, rule-based process with full public input. \r\n\r\n**Our Take:** The debate underscores a key regulatory question: should new technology inherit old rules, or be granted space to redefine them? The outcome could reshape how equities are traded in a blockchain-powered future.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.
