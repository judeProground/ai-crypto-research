  "body": "According to [rwa.xyz](http://rwa.xyz), there is $25B in RWAs onchain, 295k RWA asset holders, $243B in stablecoins (tokenized cash), and 171M stablecoin holders. \r\n\r\nThe numbers are mind boggling and yet weâ€™re still early.\r\n\r\nNomatic and I believe this is the equivalent of 2020 for RWAs.\r\n\r\nThink about how much DeFi grew between 2020 and 2025â€”thatâ€™s whatâ€™s coming for RWAs but now with favorable regulation, major institutional adoption of DeFi, and stablecoins being the ChatGPT moment for DeFi/Ethereum, it looks more like 1000x growth ahead for RWAs over the next 10 years.\r\n\r\nThis week on [The Edge Podcast](http://linktr.ee/edge_pod), weâ€™re joined by [RedStone](http://redstone.finance) CoFounders [Jakub Wojciechowski](http://x.com/kuba_redstone) and [Marcin KaÅºmierczak](http://x.com/marcinredstone) to explore how their oracle network is becoming foundational infrastructure for the next era of RWAs onchain. From powering stablecoins and LRTs to supporting Apolloâ€™s tokenized private credit through Securitize, RedStone is playing a key role in helping RWA protocols scale with security and composability.\r\n\r\nWe talk about why RWAs are set for such astounding growth in the coming decade, what RedStone is doing differently from legacy oracles, and how their modular approach, through tools like RedStone Atom, offers a smarter, more future-proof way to provide data for onchain blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”\r\n\r\n_**Thanks to our sponsors for making it possible to create and share this content!**_\r\n\r\n| CONTINUE BELOW FOR PODCAST LINKS |\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a333c686-2ab5-459b-8e98-f2e04c54c1e5/photo_2025-05-27_14.36.41.jpeg?t=1748371006)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.magicnewton.com/)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0b1e2835-a8ce-48b8-86d6-70d1cdce2ee9/photo_2025-06-23_11.30.35.jpeg?t=1750692695)\r\nFollow image link: (https://app.maple.finance/earn?referral=Mig0gHP59IYC)\r\nCaption: syrupUSDC by Maple: DeFiâ€™s Premium Yield Asset\r\n\r\nSpark: Earn on your stablecoins: (https://link.spark.fi/Defi_Dad)\r\n\r\nMantle: The Future of On-Chain Finance & Banking: (https://group.mantle.xyz/)\r\n\r\nGearbox âœ¨ Lending Reimagined: (https://gearbox.fi/)\r\n\r\nRumpel Protocol | Turn Points Into Profit: (https://www.rumpel.xyz/)\r\n\r\nPuffer: Building the Future of Ethereum: (https://www.puffer.fi/)\r\n\r\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”\r\n\r\n_Listen to every episode of The Edge Podcast on Pods, Apple, Spotify, and more _[_here_](http://linktr.ee/edge_pod)_!_\r\n\r\nThe Oracle Behind A New Wave of RWAs Onchain: (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UFnRd1RvCQPLTHoZtFbXm?si=G_Kjq8-LR0aQe5YFrSSx-Q)\r\n\r\nThe Oracle Behind A New Wave of RWAs Onchain: (https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-oracle-behind-a-new-wave-of-rwas-onchain/id1671489227?i=1000716897784)\r\n\r\nThe Oracle Behind A New Wave of RWAs Onchain: (https://pods.media/edge/the-oracle-behind-a-new-wave-of-rwas-onchain)\r\n\r\nYoutube: The Oracle Behind A New Wave of RWAs Onchain (https://youtu.be/M1-2N7y3nRc)\r\n\r\nðŸ”—** Guest Links **ðŸ”—\r\n\r\nâ–º RedStone website: [redstone.finance](https://www.redstone.finance/)\r\n\r\nâ–º RedStone RWA Report: [blog.redstone.finance/2025/06/26/real-world-assets-in-onchain-finance-report/](https://blog.redstone.finance/2025/06/26/real-world-assets-in-onchain-finance-report/)\r\n\r\nâ–º RedStone on X: [x.com/redstone_defi](https://x.com/redstone_defi)\r\n\r\nâ–º Jakub on X: [x.com/kuba_redstone](https://x.com/kuba_redstone)\r\n\r\nâ–º Marcin on X: [x.com/marcinredstone](https://x.com/marcinredstone)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”\r\n\r\n* _Follow __[@DeFi_Dad](https://x.com/defi_dad)__ on X (Twitter)_\r\n\r\n* _Follow __[@Nomaticcap](https://x.com/Nomaticcap)__ on X (Twitter)_\r\n\r\n* _Subscribe to The Edge Podcast via __[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/edge_pod)_\r\n\r\n* _Watch The Edge Podcast on __[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@defidad)_\r\n\r\n* _Collect every episode onchain on __[Pods](https://pods.media/edge)_\r\n\r\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”\r\n\r\n_Disclosure: DeFi Dad and Nomatic are angel investors in RedStone._\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€”â€”â€”\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
