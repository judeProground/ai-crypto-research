This is a very very smart move from Phantom, also showing how powerful liquidity as a service is from HYPE. Liquidity is CEX‚Äôs largest moat, and Hyperliquid really changes the paradigm by opening it up for builders. Crypto ethos, at least from the business POV, has always stood on the side of: \"we decentralize it, own less of the pie, but let‚Äôs grow the pie together\".\r\n\r\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\r\n\r\n**In Today's Email:**\r\n\r\n* **What Matters:** Strategy‚Äôs $4.2B Preferred Stock Sale üí∞Ô∏è \r\n\r\n* **Case Study:** SharpLink Holds 205K ETH üîé \r\n\r\n* **Governance & Features:** Phantom Adds Perp Trading üëª \r\n\r\nYou read and share. _We listen and improve_.

You need a very clear differentiation these days.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ee9530b4-5ac4-4ca0-88e3-1bd3b03292ad/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**CASE STUDY**\r\n\r\n## **SharpLink Now Holds 205K ETH**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/29e0b700-1db8-490e-b626-45b41999af35/image.png?t=1752034644)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nSharpLink Gaming [disclosed it holds 205,634 ETH ](https://www.theblock.co/post/361607/sharplink-gaming-discloses-holding-205634-eth-in-second-largest-treasury-behind-ethereum-foundation)worth about **$527.4M** as of July 4, making it the second-largest ether treasury after the Ethereum Foundation. \r\n\r\n* Between June 28 and July 4, SharpLink bought **7,689 ETH** for approximately **$19.7M** at an average price of **$2,501** per token.\r\n\r\n* The company raised **$64M** by selling nearly **5.5M** shares through an at-the-market program, planning to use **$37.2M** of that to buy more ETH. \r\n\r\n* Since launching its ether-focused treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has also earned **322 ETH (~$826,000)** from staking rewards.\r\n\r\nThe pivot toward aggressively building an ETH treasury follows a **$425M **private placement led by Consensys. Joseph Lubin, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder, became SharpLink‚Äôs chairman in June.\r\n\r\n* The move puts SharpLink alongside other public companies like DeFi Development Corporation and Upexi that are building significant altcoin treasuries in 2025.\r\n\r\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.

Critics called it ‚Äúbad optics‚Äù since the project has already made **$700M** from revenue and users expected an airdrop, not a big token sale.\r\n\r\n* The deleted listing valued PUMP at **$4B overall**, sparking accusations that the sale was opportunistic amid a cooling memecoin market. \r\n\r\n* While an airdrop may still happen, no official statements have clarified the sale‚Äôs status. \r\n\r\n* Pump.fun has also lost ground to competitor LetsBonk, which has surpassed it in tokens created and revenue.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/368537c9-5c99-490d-af07-8bd1f4ee7b41/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**FEATURES & GOVERNANCE UPDATE**\r\n\r\n## **Phantom Adds Perp Trading via Hyperliquid**\r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/phantom/status/1942628993636917311)\r\n\r\nPhantom is [launching](https://www.theblock.co/post/361533/phantom-wallet-perp-trading-hyperliquid) perp contract trading directly inside its web3 wallet, starting with EU users.

strategy to make wallets the main hub for onchain activity, as exchanges also expand their perp trading offerings.\r\n\r\n* Hyperliquid has handled over **$1.57T in perp trading volume** in the past
