The sale was part of the investor’s estate planning strategy, with Galaxy executing multiple block trades and transferring much of the BTC directly to exchanges. Despite the scale, the market absorbed the move with only a modest, short-term decline before Bitcoin prices rebounded.\r\n\r\n[[Read more]](https://cointelegraph.com/news/early-bitcoin-investor-sells-80000-btc-galaxy-digital)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n### ✉️ A Message From Delve:\r\n\r\n### Time to change compliance forever.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e6e583ac-884c-4c25-b6fd-98e69b9b08de/A.png?t=1753372141)\r\nFollow image link: (https://delve.co/book-demo?utm_source=beehiv&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=beehiv-primary-jul22-25_485QWNDALO&_bhiiv=opp_eb133e2b-5397-471d-94d9-173096b953bb_fd1958ac&bhcl_id=cc3e6743-93db-44c6-a3b1-534fcc811d67_49f19459-cfc1-47b4-a90b-77e7ee215729)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWe’re thrilled to announce our [$32M Series A at a $300M](https://delve.co/book-demo?utm_source=beehiv&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=beehiv-primary-jul22-25_485QWNDALO&_bhiiv=opp_eb133e2b-5397-471d-94d9-173096b953bb_fd1958ac&bhcl_id=cc3e6743-93db-44c6-a3b1-534fcc811d67_49f19459-cfc1-47b4-a90b-77e7ee215729) valuation, led by Insight Partners! \r\n\r\nDelve is shaping the future of GRC with an AI-native approach that cuts busywork and saves teams hundreds of hours.

Despite strong competition from [LetsBONK.fun](https://LetsBONK.fun) and dilution risks, $PUMP’s oversold technicals and sector-wide Solana memecoin momentum give bulls hope for a rebound if platform relevance and rewards are managed well. Key to upside: breaking $0.0033 and regaining market share.\r\n\r\n^*****^^_Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice; always do your own research before making any investment decisions._^\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/42bac0be-f091-4b4b-a95d-c250412a1700/Screenshot_2025-07-28_at_5.58.24_PM.png?t=1753696734)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nShare RAREMINTS\r\n\r\nYou currently have <strong>0</strong> referrals, only <strong>1</strong> away from receiving <strong>[Guide] Five Secret Tools to 10x Your Crypto Investment</strong>.\r\n\r\nOr copy and paste this link to others: https://www.raremints.com/subscribe?ref=1QCU2q1iEr\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80406fad-fa48-474c-a4f7-2d034570a6ae/advertise.png)\r\nFollow image link: (mailto:hello@raremints.com)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n#### ✨\r\n\r\n\r\n#### \r\nFollow RAREMINTS For \r\nReal-Time Web 3 \r\nNews & Insights ⬇️\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f4ac5ae2-ad49-4483-a2bf-4a8959fac701/follow.jpg)\r\nFollow image link: (https://twitter.com/raremints_?utm_source=www.raremints.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=your-daily-dyor)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
