  "body": "ETH treasury companies, aka digital asset treasuries (DATs), have quickly becoming some of the most talked-about stocks on Wall Street. They are in a heated race to source and buy as much ETH as they can in order to win investor favor and stand out in a growing field of competitors holding ETH on their balance sheets.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0aaf5ef9-59e0-4c16-ae00-a47cb2da8889/Screenshot_2025-07-27_at_12.28.34_PM.png?t=1753633734)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.strategicethreserve.xyz/)\r\nCaption: Top ETH DATs according to strategicethreserve.xyz\r\n\r\nWith Ethereum CoFounder [Joe Lubin](http://x.com/ethereumjoseph) becoming Chairman of [Sharplink Gaming](http://sharplink.com) ($SBET) and Wall Street media darling, Fundstrat’s CIO [Tom Lee](https://x.com/fundstrat) becoming Chairman of [Bitmine](http://bitminetech.io) ($BMNR), plus a handful of other publicly traded companies with media-friendly leadership such as [BTCS](https://www.btcs.com/) ($BTCS),  [Bit Digital](https://bit-digital.com/) ($BTBT), and former ConsenSys employee [Andrew Keys](http://AK_ethermachine) leading [The Ether Machine](http://ethermachine.com) ($DYNX), there is now an outsized bid for ETH’s rapidly shrinking supply. \r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1946035234543407545)\r\n\r\nIn this episode of [The Edge Podcast](http://linktr.ee/edge_pod), we provide a comprehensive guide on how these ETH treasury companies are acquiring and staking ETH for their treasuries while tapping into Ethereum DeFi to earn yield. We explore how these firms raise capital to buy more ETH, how staking/DeFi differentiates them from BTC treasury companies like Microstrategy, why metrics like mNAV, share count, and ETH purchase-to-issuance ratio matter, and how this new phenomenon has changed Wall Street’s attitude towards ETH as a SoV.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_**Thanks to our sponsors for making it possible to create and share this content!**_\r\n\r\n| CONTINUE BELOW FOR PODCAST LINKS |\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/77709f69-7a88-48b9-8f57-f6e650ddad08/photo_2025-07-15_20.32.06.jpeg?t=1752625946)\r\nFollow image link: (https://x.com/redstone_defi/status/1938235868969586997)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0b1e2835-a8ce-48b8-86d6-70d1cdce2ee9/photo_2025-06-23_11.30.35.jpeg?t=1750692695)\r\nFollow image link: (https://app.maple.finance/earn?referral=Mig0gHP59IYC)\r\nCaption: syrupUSDC by Maple: DeFi’s Premium Yield Asset\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c4798537-b607-4862-9a4c-8e3ebb24e351/IMG_3770.PNG?t=1752625817)\r\nFollow image link: (https://app.falcon.finance?r=0ec4ccafcd94a7756710278ebfd7dd4b)\r\nCaption: Points season is now live on falcon.finance\r\n\r\nSpark: Earn on your stablecoins: (https://link.spark.fi/Defi_Dad)\r\n\r\nMantle: The Future of On-Chain Finance & Banking: (https://group.mantle.xyz/)\r\n\r\nGearbox ✨ Lending Reimagined: (https://gearbox.fi/)\r\n\r\nRumpel Protocol | Turn Points Into Profit: (https://www.rumpel.xyz/)\r\n\r\nPuffer: Building the Future of Ethereum: (https://www.puffer.fi/)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_Listen to every episode of The Edge Podcast on Pods, Apple, Spotify, and more __[here](http://linktr.ee/edge_pod)__!_\r\n\r\nA Beginner’s Guide To ETH Treasury Companies: (https://open.spotify.com/episode/1NNf0K7rID2PJz4r7b0OSQ?si=f5zVco-GS8CVVkcw2zZCVg)\r\n\r\nA Beginner’s Guide To ETH Treasury Companies: (https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-beginners-guide-to-eth-treasury-companies/id1671489227?i=1000719379729)\r\n\r\nYoutube: A Beginner’s Guide To ETH Treasury Companies (https://youtu.be/tE4qCz2IchA)\r\n\r\nA Beginner’s Guide To ETH Treasury Companies: (https://pods.media/edge/a-beginners-guide-to-eth-treasury-companies)\r\n\r\n🔗** Guest Links **🔗\r\n\r\n► Strategic ETH Reserve website: [strategicethreserve.xyz](https://strategicethreserve.xyz/)\r\n\r\n► Crypto Treasuries website: [cryptotreasuries.com](https://cryptotreasuries.com/)\r\n\r\n► Milk Road website: [milkroad.com](https://milkroad.com/)\r\n\r\n► Milk Road on X: [x.com/MilkRoadDaily](https://x.com/MilkRoadDaily)\r\n\r\n► Impact3 website: [impact3.co](https://impact3.co/)\r\n\r\n► Impact3 on X: [x.com/Impact3Growth](https://x.com/Impact3Growth)\r\n\r\n► Kyle on X: [x.com/kyleReidhead](https://x.com/kyleReidhead)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n* _Follow __[@DeFi_Dad](https://x.com/defi_dad)__ on X (Twitter)_\r\n\r\n* _Follow __[@Nomaticcap](https://x.com/Nomaticcap)__ on X (Twitter)_\r\n\r\n* _Subscribe to The Edge Podcast via __[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/edge_pod)_\r\n\r\n* _Watch The Edge Podcast on __[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@defidad)_\r\n\r\n* _Collect every episode onchain on __[Pods](https://pods.media/edge)_\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_Disclosure: Kyle, DeFi Dad and Nomatic all hold ETH and SBET.
