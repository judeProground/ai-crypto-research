Circle could soon begin holding USDC reserves directly under OCC supervision, while Ripple may get similar treatment for RLUSD.\r\n\r\n**Why it Matters:** These applications show how fast crypto companies are moving to integrate with the US financial system. A federal bank license could boost confidence among regulators, institutional investors, and corporate clients.\r\n\r\n**Our Take:** This signals that stablecoins are shifting further into the regulated mainstream.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0527dc80-ade1-46a8-8bce-b259d4df58aa/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**GLOBAL LEGAL ROUNDUP**\r\n\r\n### **America:**\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** Financial industry group** [pushes back](https://www.theblock.co/post/360853/financial-industry-group-pushes-back-on-tokenized-equities-urges-sec-to-reject-crypto-firms-exemptions) on tokenized equities.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** NY Attorney General **[warns](https://www.theblock.co/post/360649/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-warns-stablecoin-bills-put-americans-at-risk-urges-stronger-oversight) stablecoin bills put Americans at risk.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** Crypto tax amendment** [dropped](https://www.theblock.co/post/360600/crypto-tax-amendment-dropped-from-senates-big-beautiful-bill-but-sen-lummis-plans-to-keep-pushing) from Senate's 'Big, Beautiful Bill.’\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** TradFi group** [calls](https://www.theblock.co/post/361044/sifma-sec-crypto-task-force) on SEC to establish open, progressive crypto rules.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** Arizona governor** [vetoes](https://www.theblock.co/post/360672/arizona-governor-vetoes-bill-reserve-seized-crypto) bill seeking reserve fund from seized crypto.\r\n\r\n* 🇺🇲** Sen.

However, these products sit in a legal gray zone. \r\n\r\n* Investors don’t actually own shares when they buy tokenized stocks. \r\n\r\n* Instead, they hold digital tokens issued by intermediaries, which don’t grant voting rights, direct claims on company assets, or access to financial information. \r\n\r\n* This gap led to confusion when Robinhood began offering “OpenAI tokens” in Europe—tokens that turned out not to represent any real stake in OpenAI.\r\n\r\nIndustry experts warn that such misunderstandings could become common. John Murillo of B2BROKER emphasized that investors must clearly understand the limits of tokenized equity.\r\n\r\n* Attorney Tyler Yagman argued that clearer regulations are urgently needed to protect retail buyers and ensure transparency.\r\n\r\n* Encouragingly, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has signaled openness to supporting tokenization, suggesting the rules may soon catch up with innovation.\r\n\r\n**Our Take:** Without clear rules, tokenized equities risk confusing investors and blurring the line between real ownership and synthetic exposure. Stronger disclosure and regulation will be essential to build trust and prevent misuse\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.
