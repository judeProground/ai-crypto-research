  "body": "**Why this report matters**\r\n\r\nBitcoin just posted its strongest breakout since 2024—fueled by a sharp surge in inflows, call buying, and one of the largest short liquidations in years. But with implied volatility fading and the options market now aggressively pricing in a $140K year-end target, are traders too far ahead of themselves? \r\n\r\nRetail volume is exploding in Korea, and altcoins are ripping—but the inflow math may be telling a different story. Meanwhile, Coinbase is now trading at a 22% premium to Bitcoin, near the top of its historical range. Is this the time to stay long, hedge, or fade the rally? The capital flow data, trend model shifts, and derivatives signals in this report reveal what’s likely next—and where the risk/reward is most asymmetric.\r\n\r\n **Bitcoin (LHS) vs. Coinbase (RHS), +107% since our May 12 report**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ac3a0bea-b0c6-436c-b82c-7fac2898ca41/image.png?t=1753148733)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**Main argument**\r\n\r\nOn June 24 ([here](https://update.10xresearch.com/p/why-wall-street-s-favorite-bitcoin-trade-might-be-hiding-in-plain-sight-8bbe)), we turned bullish Bitcoin as it approached the end of a six-week consolidation. Anticipating a July breakout, we recommended going long Bitcoin at $104,000 while selling the $115,000 July 25 call, expecting a +10% move and viewing the call sale as an attractive yield enhancement. At the time, the call offered an 18% annualized yield, in addition to Bitcoin exposure.\r\n\r\nThat option, originally priced at $1,560, is now trading around $2,990 with just three days to expiry. While the call has moved against us by $1,400, the long Bitcoin leg is up $13,400, resulting in a net gain of $12,000 (so far). And with consolidation likely to occur into the July 25 option expiry, the call option could still lose value, ultimately capturing the yield we initially targeted.\r\n\r\nWhen demand for upside calls significantly outweighs demand for downside put protection—as seen in the widening skew between call and put implied volatility—it often signals an increased risk of a price reversal in Bitcoin. While current levels are not yet extreme, this imbalance still raises the probability of a near-term consolidation.\r\n\r\n**Bitcoin (LHS) vs. Skew (RHS, vol points, implied vol for puts over calls)**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5e45049e-959e-4e21-a063-54d3dd6cfd79/image.png?t=1753148824)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nBack in late June, it was the way the derivatives market was pricing Bitcoin’s upside that helped shift our stance to a more bullish one. Since then, the options market has undergone a significant reversal—demand for upside exposure now outweighs interest in downside protection, often a signal that Bitcoin may be due for consolidation as positioning becomes crowded. In early July, we observed a sharp flip: traders moved from predominantly selling calls to aggressively buying them, signaling a renewed appetite for upside.\r\n\r\nAfter peaking at 64.7% during the Trump inauguration in January, implied volatility bottomed at 34.7% on July 8. However, even now, at 38%, it remains relatively low, given the rally to $117,000. This reflects a structural shift, as traders are moving toward systematic call selling, driven by declining realized volatility and increasing institutional participation. This environment favors strategies like our current call overwriting approach, which aims to add 15–20% annualized yield on top of Bitcoin returns, especially when timed around key catalysts.\r\n\r\nA significant number of outstanding call options expiring in late September are targeting a $140,000 Bitcoin price, with similar positioning seen for the December expiry. However, December also shows notable open interest at even more ambitious strikes—$150,000, $170,000, and $200,000. Beyond those levels, though, there’s little market interest in pricing further upside for this year, suggesting a cap on bullish expectations despite the enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWhile many commentators toss out arbitrary Bitcoin price targets, we prefer to anchor our projections in actual capital flows. Based on year-to-date inflows of $195 billion, reaching a $160,000 Bitcoin price would require an additional $281 billion, assuming the historical multiplier of roughly 2.8x remains intact. For context, it took $1 trillion of cumulative inflows to drive Bitcoin’s market cap to $2.33 trillion. Our latest 2025 year-end projection stands at $141,861, suggesting that while upside remains, one or two more meaningful rallies would be needed, likely with at least one material move in Q4.\r\n\r\n**US$ inflows needed to achieve the 2025 year-end Bitcoin price**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/fc584a05-1c5f-479b-8880-1fc19b3db2d9/image.png?t=1753148997)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWith five months still to go, an additional $151 billion in capital would be required, on top of the $195 billion already allocated this year, to reach our projected ($141,861) target for Bitcoin. Every $72 billion in net inflows would translate into a $10,000 increase in Bitcoin’s price. This means that pushing Bitcoin above $160,000 would require nearly double the pace of inflows seen so far in 2025, despite the market already having digested several major bullish catalysts.\r\n\r\n**$346 billion will have been moved into BTC this year if the pace continues**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9f9b7aef-2c98-4251-85bc-1338027f8c3f/image.png?t=1753149109)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWith U.S. Crypto Week now behind us and the anticipated White House digital asset report delayed from its expected initial release, attention turns to the July 30 FOMC meeting as the next key policy catalyst. Following that, Washington will enter its traditional summer slowdown: the House begins recess on July 25, with the Senate expected to follow by July 31, and both chambers reconvening after Labor Day on September 2. This ushers in a quieter policy window, though, as always, political surprises (from Trump) remain possible. Historically, August and September tend to be seasonally weaker periods for markets, making this a natural pause point.\r\n\r\nThis is why a consolidation in Bitcoin and crypto stocks, such as Coinbase, seems increasingly possible. Coinbase has rolled out a series of bullish catalysts recently, including offering 4% rewards on its debit card and expanding into U.S. perpetual futures, positioning itself as a potential “everything app.” Its inclusion in the S&P 500 on June 24 further fueled the rally, pushing the stock from undervalued to now trading at a +22% premium relative to Bitcoin, near the top of its historical valuation range. We flagged this shift in our May 12 report ([here](https://update.10xresearch.com/p/major-crypto-drivers-in-the-weeks-ahead-0b58)), when Coinbase was still undervalued; now the opposite holds true.\r\n\r\n**Based on our regression analysis, Coinbase is +22% overvalued vs. Bitcoin**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a1b22497-f613-4e76-a3b1-44be0c8da9f0/image.png?t=1753149226)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nSince our June 27 note ([here](https://update.10xresearch.com/p/is-coinbase-running-too-hot-after-its-88-rally-21a3)) warning of overvaluation, both Bitcoin and Coinbase have risen by roughly 10%. However, we continue to prefer Bitcoin over Coinbase. The latter now trades at a stretched valuation, reflecting peak bullish sentiment and a significant premium relative to Bitcoin. Coinbase’s stock is not only tightly correlated to Bitcoin but also to crypto trading volumes, which, despite a recent surge, are likely to taper off into the slower summer months.\r\n\r\n**Divergence between Crypto Trading Volumes (LHS, $bn) vs. Coinbase (RHS)**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/942dd3d5-44ff-4609-9662-cf0977e2c64d/image.png?t=1753149320)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nSigns of fatigue are already emerging, with U.S. investors beginning to sell Bitcoin and funding rates suggesting that overextended long positions may soon unwind. Coinbase reports Q2 2025 earnings on July 31, but with a forward P/E of 145x, the stock looks expensive against a backdrop of mounting headwinds. At best, our view on Coinbase is neutral; however, it increasingly makes sense to either buy puts or short the stock relative to Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nBitcoin’s rally has been impressive, but the inflow math shows there’s still a long way to go—and the clock is ticking. The options market is flashing signs of crowding, with $140K+ targets dominating the board, just as volatility begins to compress. Retail volume is peaking, Coinbase is trading at a 22% premium to Bitcoin, and trend models are signaling it's time to be selective. \r\n\r\nCapital flow projections suggest one more major leg higher is possible—but only if fresh inflows materialize soon. The next major test will likely come after the summer; our full breakdown of setups and catalysts will follow. While we still anticipate higher Bitcoin prices, the summer may bring a lull, leaving room for one or two meaningful rallies before year-end.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
