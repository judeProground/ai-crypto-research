  "body": "### **10 Questions**\r\n\r\n1.Can you walk us through your background and how it led you to start Union?\r\n2. How do you explain what you’re building at Union to non-technical friends or family?3. “Cross-chain” and “interoperability” have been buzzwords for a long time. What’s something unique about Union’s approach?\r\n4. Cross-chain systems have historically been vulnerable to exploits. How does Union approach security and minimize potential attack vectors?\r\n5. Could you share a few real-world use cases or projects already building on Union?\r\n6. One thing that stands out about Union is the research your team publishes. Are there 1–2 articles or papers you’d recommend for someone who wants to understand your design philosophy more deeply?\r\n7. Outside of Union, which teams or protocols do you find particularly interesting right now?\r\n8. What’s one narrative or theme you think is underrated in the current crypto cycle?\r\n9. What’s your advice to someone young who wants to start building in crypto today?\r\n10. Lastly, any alphas or thoughts you'd like to leave us with?\r\n\r\nSubscribe (https://presto.beehiiv.com/subscribe)\r\n\r\n### **Summary**\r\n\r\nIn this episode, we sit down with Union founder Karel to learn how Union is building mathematically secure, trustless bridge protocol using ZKP.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0c82a0d0-4f96-4465-8459-0f5c7efc3fe9/250722_Interview_article_docs_cover_thumbnail.png?t=1753322793)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nRead full report (https://www.prestolabs.io/research/karel-union-zk-interoperability-and-trustlessness)\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n### About Presto Research Offerings\r\n\r\n* **Daily Market Brief** is issued every 9AM SGT on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. _Daily mailing distribution is limited to select media._\r\n\r\n* **Weekly Hot Take** provides key insights into latest trends primarily in digital assets.\r\n\r\n* **Blockchain Focus** takes a deep-dive into a blockchain topic of interest.\r\n\r\n* **Trade Ideas** is an in-depth analysis of data-driven trading ideas.\r\n\r\nA weekly summary of the DMBs and all research is provided on Saturday.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\nFor speaker engagements, trading commentary, subscription to Daily Market Brief or any other PR related inquires, please contact: Thomas ([thomas@prestolabs.io](mailto:thomas@prestolabs.io) or @thomas_presto on Telegram)\r\n\r\nPresto Research is also available on [Telegram channel](https://t.me/presto_research).\r\n\r\nHas this been helpful?
