Ethereum led the losses, but the broad selloff reflects systemic fragility during macro stress. Risk appetite is likely to remain muted until volatility settles.\r\n\r\n**For builders and investors:** Focus on resilience. You may want to reduce leverage, prioritize liquidity, and watch for oversold opportunities with strong fundamentals.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ee9530b4-5ac4-4ca0-88e3-1bd3b03292ad/image.png)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**PRODUCT OF THE WEEK**\r\n\r\n## **Kraken’s Native BTC Yield via Babylon**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a6d3e4cc-1fce-47be-a952-42555c113d55/BTCStaking_1535x700_2X-1.jpg?t=1750658480)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nKraken has [launched](https://www.theblock.co/post/358973/kraken-bitcoin-staking-babylon) a new bitcoin “staking” feature using Babylon, allowing users to earn up to **1% APR** on BTC without wrapping, lending, or bridging. \r\n\r\n* The integration uses Babylon’s time-lock protocol to secure PoS chains while keeping BTC on its native blockchain. \r\n\r\n* Rewards are paid in Babylon’s BABY token, with a seven-day unbonding period. \r\n\r\n* The service is available in select regions, and Kraken is the first major exchange to offer this non-custodial, smart-contract-managed BTC yield option. \r\n\r\n##### **Other cool products: **\r\n\r\n* [Bankroll](https://bankroll.network/), an onchain community bank.\r\n\r\n* [Alephium Bridge](https://bridge.alephium.org/), a bridge between Ethereum and Alephium.\r\n\r\n* [Helix](https://www.helixapp.com/), a decentralized spot and derivatives exchange on Injective.\r\n\r\n* [Belt Finance](https://belt.fi/), an all-in-one DeFi protocol on BSC, HECO, and Klaytn. \r\n\r\n* [Crestal Nation](https://nation.fun/), a no-code platform for building autonomous AI agents on Base.\r\n\r\n———————————————————————————\r\n\r\n_Take a peek at our referral reward at the bottom of this issue.

Friday](https://www.theblock.co/post/359084/spot-ethereum-etfs-log-largest-outflows-in-one-month-as-eth-price-tumbles-below-2400), the highest since mid-May, led by a **$19.7M exit **from BlackRock’s
