‚ö†Ô∏è [DEFI] [FUNDING] *<https://strategy.10xresearch.com/p/ethereum-chart-book-most-important-daily-weekly-monthly-charts-df9d|Ethereum Breaks Out with $84B DeFi Growth and $3B ETF Inflows>* (Source: 10x Research): Ethereum experienced a significant breakout month with $84 billion in DeFi activity, $3 billion in ETF inflows, and open interest surging $11 billion (79% increase) in three weeks. The technical analysis suggests this could be a structural turning point, driven by institutional positioning and Asian repricing, with funding rates remaining subdued indicating spot buying rather than leverage.

The project raised $550M and DT Marks (Trump-affiliated) holds 15.75B WLFI tokens potentially worth $3.6B at current prices.

The $10.8T asset manager currently has $25B in crypto assets and aims to compete directly with Coinbase by consolidating client crypto holdings.

This positions them among the top public ETH treasuries and comes amid surging institutional demand for ETH ETFs, which now account for over 10% of ETH market activity.

## üí° Strategic Insights

**Institutional Infrastructure Maturation**: The convergence of $84B DeFi activity with traditional finance entry (Schwab) and corporate treasury adoption signals crypto's transition from speculative asset to institutional infrastructure. Investors should monitor this institutional demand cycle as it typically precedes sustained price appreciation and reduced volatility.

**Ethereum Ecosystem Dominance**: Multiple funding vectors point to Ethereum as the primary beneficiary of institutional adoption - from ETF inflows to corporate treasuries to DeFi growth. This positioning suggests Ethereum may outperform Bitcoin in institutional allocation strategies during 2025.

**Supply-Demand Dynamics Shifting**: While institutional demand accelerates, potential government asset sales ($7B+ from UK) create near-term supply pressure concerns. However, the 4-year legal timeline for UK sales and strong spot buying patterns suggest demand will likely absorb these flows without significant market disruption.
