# üîó Blockchain Market Intelligence Report for 2025-07-09

## Executive Summary

The blockchain market is experiencing a transformative regulatory wave with the introduction of the GENIUS Act establishing the first federal framework for US stablecoins, complementing recent FASB crypto accounting standards and driving unprecedented institutional adoption. Major corporations are aggressively accumulating crypto assets, with MicroStrategy launching a $4.2B preferred stock sale and SharpLink Gaming building a $527M ETH treasury, while stablecoin issuance has surged since November 2024. However, regulatory crackdowns continue globally as evidenced by New Zealand's crypto ATM ban and a $650M fraud case, highlighting the ongoing tension between innovation and enforcement in the evolving digital asset landscape.
