    "title": "Ethereum Breaks Out with $84B DeFi Growth and $3B ETF Inflows",
    "summary": "Ethereum experienced a significant breakout month with $84 billion in DeFi activity, $3 billion in ETF inflows, and open interest surging $11 billion (79% increase) in three weeks. The technical analysis suggests this could be a structural turning point, driven by institutional positioning and Asian repricing, with funding rates remaining subdued indicating spot buying rather than leverage.",
