    "title": "Bitcoin Correction Aligns with Fed Rate Cut Expectations and Economic Weakness",
    "summary": "Bitcoin dropped below $112,000 in typical August seasonality, coinciding with downward U.S. labor market revisions that mirror last year's dynamics when the Fed cut rates by 50bp in September. Analysis suggests markets are correctly pricing two rate cuts starting in September, with potential for sharp rebounds once cuts become certain, similar to previous year-end rallies.",
