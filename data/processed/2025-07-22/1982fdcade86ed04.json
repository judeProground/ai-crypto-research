    "summary": "Bitcoin posted its strongest 2024 breakout reaching $117K, driven by $195 billion in inflows and massive short liquidations. However, the options market now aggressively prices a $140K year-end target with implied volatility at only 38%, suggesting potential overextension. Reaching the projected $141,861 target would require an additional $151 billion in inflows over the remaining 5 months.",
