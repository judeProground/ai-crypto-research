# Project: Blockchain & Crypto Researching Bot

## 1. Overview

The project aims to build a bot that automates the process of researching blockchain and cryptocurrency information. It will crawl various sources like news, newsletters, and research articles, analyze them, and generate a summarized report with tags, categories, and importance levels.

## 2. Goals

-   Automate the collection of information from various sources.
-   Analyze and summarize the collected data.
-   Provide a structured and categorized final report.
