Implement a pipeline that first breaks the email body into sentences, then uses semantic chunking techniques—such as generating embeddings for sentence groups and measuring semantic distance between them—to detect topic boundaries. Utilize existing libraries (e.g., LangChain's semantic chunking splitter) or custom logic based on sentence embeddings to delineate segments. For each identified segment, create a separate content item for downstream processing. Ensure the mechanism is robust to varied email formats and can handle edge cases like overlapping topics or ambiguous boundaries. Integrate error handling for LLM API calls and provide configuration options for chunking sensitivity.",
